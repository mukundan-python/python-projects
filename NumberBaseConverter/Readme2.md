Number Base Converter
A GUI-based number base conversion tool built using Python and Tkinter.

This application allows users to convert values between:

Binary (Base 2)
Decimal (Base 10)
Hexadecimal (Base 16)
Overview
This project was created to demonstrate understanding of:

Number base systems
Python data type conversion
GUI development using Tkinter
Input validation and error handling
The program converts user input into decimal internally and then reformats it into the selected base.

Features
Clean graphical interface
Conversion between all three number systems
Error handling for invalid inputs
Structured layout using Tkinter
How It Works
The program:

Takes user input.
Converts the input into decimal using Python’s int() function.
Converts the decimal value into the desired base using format() or built-in base functions.
Displays the result in the interface.
Example:

Binary input: 1010 Decimal output: 10
Technologies Used
Python 3
Tkinter (standard Python GUI library)
How to Run
Install Python (3.x).
Download or clone the repository.
Run:
Possible Improvements
Add input field validation (restrict characters based on selected base)
Remove base prefixes automatically (0b / 0x)
Improve UI styling
Add automated unit testing
Expand to support more number systems (e.g. octal)
